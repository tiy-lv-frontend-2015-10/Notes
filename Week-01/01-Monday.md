#### HTML 101
- HTML is a language used to describe the structure and/or content of web pages.
- CSS is a language used to describe the appearance of web pages.
- An element is composed of three parts: an opening tag, content, and a closing
  tag. There are a few elements, like `<img>`, that are an exception to this rule.
- All html documents should have tags for `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- `<head>` is information *about* the document.
- `<body>` is the content of the document.
- Elements can have attributes as well. Attributes are written inside the
  opening tag of an element, e.g. the 'src' in `<img src="image.jpg">`
- Most whitespace (tabs, returns, spaces) is ignored by the browser, but you can
  use it to make your HTML more readable.

#### Links
- You can create a link element with the `<a>` tag. You specify the location to
  link to in the `href` attribute of the tag and the title in the content, e.g.
  `<a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a>`
- You can use words or an image as the content for a link.

#### Block vs inline
- Block level elements like `<p>` ol, ul, li and `<blockquote>` appear on their
  own line and expand all the way to the left and right of their container.

#### Semantics
- You should always use the element that is closest to meaning to the type of
  your content, even if the appearance is incorrect. You can adjust the
  appearance with CSS.

#### Void elements
- Some elements are "void", meaning they don't have a closing tag. The most
  common examples are `<img>` and `<link>`

#### Images
- Use the `<img>` tag to add an image to your page. You specify the source of
  the image with the `src` attribute. The source can be a file on your site, or
  an external URL.

#### Validation
- The validator at http://html5.validator.nu is a free online service that
  checks pages for compliance with standards.

#### CSS Rules

- A block of CSS code that applies properties to a selection of elements is
  called a "rule".
- A rule is made up of a "selector" and one or more property declarations.
- The selector specifies the set of elements the rule applies to.
- A property declaration is made up of a property name and one or more property
  values.
- Each property declaration ends with a semicolon
- The list of property declarations goes between curly braces (i.e. `{ }`)

#### Example

```css
div > a // selector
{
  border-color: red;
  // property: value;
  // Also, the whole line is a "rule"
}
```
